# Remove AI Tells

I'll scan a document for patterns that signal AI-generated writing, report what was found and what percentage of the document reads as AI-written, then ask before making any changes.

## Token Optimization

**Expected range**: 400–1,200 tokens (detection + report), 50–100 tokens (early exit when file is clean), 800–2,000 tokens (detection + removal)

**Patterns used**: Grep-before-Read, early exit, progressive disclosure, git diff scope default

**Early exit**: If none of the grep patterns match, report "No AI tells found" and stop immediately — no confirmation prompt needed.

**Two-phase design**: Detection (Steps 1–3) always runs and produces the findings report plus the AI-written percentage. Removal (Steps 5–6) only runs after the user explicitly confirms in Step 4, keeping read-only runs cheap.

## Step 1 — Identify Target File(s)

Resolution order — use the first that yields a valid file:

1. **Explicit argument** — `/remove-ai-tells docs/report.md`
2. **IDE active file** — when running inside the VSCode extension, Claude Code receives the currently opened file as `<ide_opened_file>` context. If that file has a doc extension (`.md`, `.txt`, `.rst`, `.adoc`) and no argument was given, use it automatically.
3. **Staged doc files** — any staged files with a doc extension.
4. **Ask** — if none of the above yield a target, prompt the user.

```bash
# Steps 1 and 3 are bash-resolvable; step 2 is resolved from IDE context.

if [[ -n "$ARGUMENTS" ]]; then
    TARGETS="$ARGUMENTS"
elif [[ -n "$IDE_ACTIVE_FILE" ]] && echo "$IDE_ACTIVE_FILE" | grep -qE '\.(md|txt|rst|adoc)$'; then
    # IDE_ACTIVE_FILE is populated from <ide_opened_file> context when available
    TARGETS="$IDE_ACTIVE_FILE"
    echo "Using IDE active file: $TARGETS"
elif ! git diff --cached --quiet; then
    TARGETS=$(git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E '\.(md|txt|rst|adoc)$')
else
    echo "No target file specified and no staged doc files found."
    echo "Usage: /remove-ai-tells <file>"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Targets: $TARGETS"
```

## Step 2 — Grep for AI-Tell Patterns (Early Exit)

Run all pattern checks before reading any file content. If nothing matches, stop immediately.

```bash
# Filler openers (sentence-start affirmations)

# Right arrow overuse — "→" used as a prose connector or visual separator
grep -n "→" $TARGETS

# Section separator overuse — "---" on its own line (horizontal rule used as section divider)
grep -nE "^---$" $TARGETS
```

If zero matches across all patterns, output:

```
No AI tells found in <file>. Document reads naturally.
```

and stop.

## Step 3 — Categorize, Score, and Report Findings

Group matches by category and report with line numbers. Do not make any changes yet.

```
AI tells found in docs/report.md:

Filler openers (2)
  L3:  "Certainly, here is the summary..."
  L47: "Absolutely! The next step is..."

AI vocabulary (5)
  L12: "leverage the existing infrastructure"
  L18: "seamless integration"
  L29: "robust solution"
  L34: "let's delve into the specifics"
  L61: "holistic approach"

Hedge phrases (1)
  L55: "It's worth noting that performance may vary"

Transition clichés (2)
  L40: "Furthermore, this approach..."
  L70: "In conclusion, we recommend..."

Total: 10 patterns across 1 file
```

### AI-Written Percentage

After collecting all matches, compute an estimate of how AI-written the document is:

```bash
# Count total non-blank lines in the file
TOTAL_LINES=$(grep -c . "$TARGET" || echo 1)

# Count distinct lines that contain at least one AI-tell match
# (collect all grep -n output, extract line numbers, deduplicate)
HIT_LINES=$(grep -niE "<all_patterns_combined>" "$TARGET" | cut -d: -f1 | sort -u | wc -l)

# Percentage = HIT_LINES / TOTAL_LINES * 100, rounded to nearest integer
```

Report the score immediately after the findings block:

```
AI-written estimate: 14% (10 flagged lines out of 72 non-blank lines)
  Low (0–15%)    — occasional AI patterns; targeted fixes sufficient
  Medium (16–40%) — noticeable AI register; consider paragraph rewrites
  High (41%+)    — pervasive AI tone; consider full-section rewrites
```

Bracket interpretation is informational only. Always show the raw numbers so the user can judge.

## Step 4 — Ask Before Removing

After reporting the findings and score, always ask before making any changes:

```
Proceed with removal? Options:
  y   — apply all automatic fixes, then prompt for confirmation-required ones
  n   — exit without changes
  l   — list only (you already see the list above; this exits without changes)
  s   — selective: choose which categories to fix
```

Wait for the user's response. Do not apply any edits until the user confirms with `y` or `s`.

If the user chooses `s`, present each category in turn:

```
Fix "Filler openers" (2 instances)? (y/n)
Fix "AI vocabulary" (5 instances)? (y/n)
Fix "Hedge phrases" (1 instance)? (y/n)
Fix "Transition clichés" (2 instances)? (y/n)
```

Proceed only with the categories the user approves.

## Step 5 — Apply Fixes

### Automatic replacements (safe, no ambiguity)

### Confirmation-required replacements

For these, show the current line and the proposed rewrite, then ask before changing:

- Filler openers (`Certainly!`, `Absolutely!`, `Perfect!`, `Indeed,`, `Obviously,`, `Great question!`, etc.) — show the full sentence so the user can see if removing the opener changes meaning
- AI closers (`I hope this helps`, `I trust this helps`, `Let me know if you have any questions`, `Thank you for your question`, etc.) — show the paragraph end so the user can confirm removal doesn't cut real content
- Em dashes — show each occurrence in context; replace with a comma, colon, or parentheses depending on use, or remove the clause if it is padding. Flag files where em dashes appear more than once per 30 lines as likely overused.
- `→` arrows — show each occurrence in context; legitimate in code examples, tables, or CLI output, but overused in prose as a connector ("This leads to → better outcomes"). Remove from prose and rewrite as a complete sentence. Flag files where `→` appears more than once per 20 lines as likely overused.
- `---` section separators — flag standalone horizontal rules used between prose sections; remove and rely on headings for structure instead. Skip occurrences inside YAML front matter blocks or code fences.
- `leverage` when used as a noun ("leverage over competitors") — may be correct usage
- `nuanced` / `nuance` — sometimes accurate; show context and ask whether the specific distinction is named elsewhere in the sentence
- `tailored` — show context; legitimate when describing actual customization ("tailored to each team's workflow"), flagged when vague ("tailored solutions")
- `innovative` / `innovation` — confirm if referring to a named feature or product; remove if used as vague praise
- `navigate` — confirm if used literally (navigation UI, routing); flag if used as a metaphor ("navigate the complexities of")
- `comprehensive` — confirm if the document genuinely covers everything it claims; remove if used as a boast
- `vital` — confirm if the consequence of skipping is actually named; remove if used as vague emphasis
- `scalable` / `scalability` — confirm if a specific scale requirement or measurement is cited; remove if vague
- `disruptive` / `disrupt` — confirm if a specific incumbent or practice being replaced is named; remove if used as vague praise
- `drive` + object — confirm if a causal mechanism is described; remove if it is a vague action claim ("drives success")
- `elevate` — confirm if what specifically improves is named; remove if used as vague praise
- `reimagine` / `redefine` — confirm if what changes and how is specified; remove if used as aspiration language
- Wordiness patterns (`in order to`, `due to the fact that`, etc.) — auto-replacements are always safe, but show the rewritten sentence so the user can verify no meaning was lost
- Bold overuse — show a count of bolded phrases per page; ask the user which ones to remove rather than stripping all
- `accelerate` — confirm if a specific rate, timeline, or mechanism is cited; remove if used as vague praise
- `catalyst` / `catalyze` — confirm if the specific trigger and effect are named; remove if used as a metaphor for vague change
- `ecosystem` — confirm if a specific set of tools, services, or teams is named; remove if used as an abstract container word
- `paradigm shift` — confirm if what changed and what replaced it are both named; remove if used as aspiration language
- `As such,` — sometimes a legitimate logical connector ("the file was missing; as such, the build failed"); confirm before removing
- Hollow superlatives (`the best way to`, `the most important`) — show the sentence; if evidence is given in the same or next sentence, it may be justified; confirm before removing
- Validation openers (`You're right`, `That's correct`) — in genuine correction or confirmation contexts these may belong; show the full exchange and ask
- `sophisticated` — confirm if the document names the specific technical complexity; remove if used as vague praise
- `optimal` / `optimize` — confirm if a measurable criterion is stated; remove if used loosely ("the optimal approach")
- `hallmark` / `cornerstone` / `bedrock` — confirm if the document names what the trait enables or what breaks without it; remove if used as rhetorical elevation
- Assertion intensifiers (`without question`, `undeniably`) — confirm if supporting evidence appears in the same paragraph; remove if used as bluster
- Anticipatory patterns (`You might be wondering`) — flag only in prose; acceptable in FAQ sections where it introduces a listed question
- `best practices` — sometimes the appropriate term for the domain
- Self-referential phrases that may be intentional (e.g., a disclaimer section)
- Rhetorical question-answer pairs — show the question and immediate answer; offer to merge into a single declarative sentence
- Contrast structures (`It's not X, it's Y` / `Not A. Not B. But C.`) — show the sentence; rewrite as a plain positive statement
- Vague authority (`experts say`, `many believe`, `industry reports`) — remove the attribution entirely and state the claim directly, or cut the sentence if there is no specific source
- Importance sentences — any sentence whose only purpose is to state impact, legacy, significance, or broader trends without a specific claim; delete it
- Sentences over 16 words — show the sentence and a shorter rewrite; confirm before applying
- Universal sentences — any sentence that could apply to 1,000 other topics without modification; delete it
- Motivational tone — sentences written for an audience of many (TED Talk register, preaching, "you can do this" energy); rewrite for one reader or delete
- Any sentence where the replacement changes meaning or register

```
L3: "Certainly, the migration requires three steps."

## Rewrite Output Rules

These rules govern the text produced by the rewrite — not the skill's report.

- Output the clean version only — no explanation of what changed inline
- No formatting tricks: no bold to highlight fixes, no italics for emphasis, no `~~strikethrough~~`
- No summary or commentary appended after the rewritten text
- Write for one reader, not an audience — direct address, not stage register
- If a general claim has no specific backing, delete the sentence rather than hedging it

## Edge Cases

- **Non-doc files**: If the target is a code file, warn that this skill targets human-readable prose, not source code
- **Technical writing where "robust" is accurate**: If context clearly justifies the word (e.g., "RFC 9293 defines robust error recovery"), skip it and note why
- **"Comprehensive" in scope statements**: If the document explicitly lists everything it covers, `comprehensive` may be accurate — confirm before removing
- **"Tailored" describing real customization**: If the sentence names what was customized and for whom, it is not an AI tell — skip and note why
- **"Navigate" in UI/routing context**: Legitimate in technical docs describing navigation components or routing logic — skip
- **Rhetorical questions in FAQs**: Question-answer pairs are the expected format in FAQ sections — do not flag them
- **"Innovative" in product names or official titles**: Skip if part of a proper noun (e.g., "AWS Innovative Partner Program")
- **"Vital" with named consequence**: If the sentence names what breaks when the step is skipped, `vital` may be accurate — confirm before removing
- **"Scalable" with a cited measurement**: If the sentence names a specific scale target (e.g., "scalable to 10,000 concurrent users"), skip it
- **"Disruptive" naming a specific incumbent**: If the sentence names what is being replaced (e.g., "disruptive to legacy on-prem deployments"), it is not vague — confirm before removing
- **"Drive" with a measurable outcome**: If a metric or mechanism is named ("drive a 30% reduction in build time"), it is not a vague AI claim — skip
- **"Here are N ways/steps/tips" in tutorials**: This structure is appropriate in step-by-step guides; flag only in prose sections that could be written as paragraphs
- **Bold overuse in reference docs**: Tables and reference pages legitimately bold terms for quick scanning; flag only in prose paragraphs where bolding exceeds one in ten lines
- **"Accelerate" with a cited metric**: If a specific rate or deadline is named ("accelerate delivery from 6 to 3 weeks"), it is not vague — skip
- **"Ecosystem" naming specific members**: If the sentence lists the actual tools or teams ("the Node.js ecosystem: npm, Webpack, Jest"), it is not vague — skip
- **"As such" as a logical connector**: When a clear cause-effect chain is present in the same sentence, `as such` is legitimate — confirm before removing
- **"The best way to" backed by evidence**: If the next sentence provides a specific reason or benchmark, the superlative may be justified — confirm
- **"Pro tip" / "Quick tip" in genuine how-to guides**: These labels are idiomatic in tutorial writing; flag only when they precede generic advice that adds no specifics
- **"Optimize" in technical contexts**: Legitimate in engineering docs referring to specific performance work ("optimize the SQL query", "optimize bundle size") — skip when a concrete target is named
- **"Sophisticated" describing genuine technical complexity**: If the sentence lists the specific components or interactions that make something complex, it is not vague praise — skip
- **"Hallmark" / "cornerstone" in brand or standards documents**: These are idiomatic in formal organizational writing; confirm before removing rather than auto-removing
- **Anticipatory patterns in FAQ sections**: `You might be wondering` is the expected format when explicitly introducing a FAQ entry — skip; flag only in prose paragraphs
- **"Revolutionary" / "pioneering" with cited firsts**: If the sentence names what was done first and when, it is not vague — confirm before removing
- **"Unprecedented" with cited comparison**: If the sentence names the previous record or baseline being surpassed, it is not vague — confirm before removing
- **"Let me clarify" / "Allow me to" after a genuine misunderstanding**: In dialogue or correction contexts these are appropriate — confirm before removing
- **"As you may know" when knowledge cannot be assumed**: If the document is genuinely unsure whether the reader knows a prerequisite, this hedge is appropriate — confirm before removing
- **"Rest assured" in warranty or SLA language**: Standard in formal contractual writing — skip
- **"To put it another way" when the restatement adds genuine value**: If the second formulation is meaningfully different (e.g., a concrete example after an abstract statement), it may stay — confirm
- **Assertion intensifiers backed by data**: If `without question` or `undeniably` is followed in the same sentence by a cited fact or measurement, it may be intentional emphasis — confirm
- **"Crystal clear" / "abundantly clear" in instructional docs**: If the sentence contrasts a previously confusing step with a clarified one, `crystal clear` may convey a meaningful degree — confirm before removing
- **"The good news is" in genuinely mixed-finding reports**: When the document presents both positive and negative outcomes in a structured comparison, this framing may be deliberate — confirm before removing
- **"In the next section" in long reference documents**: Navigation aids are legitimate in technical reference docs with 10+ sections; flag only in prose articles where headings already serve that purpose
- **"I encourage you to" in call-to-action or closing sections**: In formal recommendation documents or closing remarks, this register may be appropriate — confirm before removing
- **"Arguably the most" backed by a comparison**: If the sentence names the alternatives being compared, the hedge is honest — confirm before removing rather than auto-removing
- **Wordiness patterns in quotations**: Do not rewrite quoted speech or cited text, even if it contains flagged circumlocutions
- **Non-English content**: Detect via charset/content check; report that patterns are English-only and skip
- **Large files (>500 lines)**: Process in sections; report progress per section
- **Multiple files**: Process each file independently; report a combined summary at the end
- **Legitimate uses of flagged words**: When a flagged word appears in a quote, code block, or heading that is intentionally citing AI output, skip it
